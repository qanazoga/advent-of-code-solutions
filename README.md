# My solutions to Advent of Code 
(starting in 2021, working backwards whenever I have time)

<hr>

[advent.core](./src/advent/core.clj) is a quick script I threw together to allow future me, or others, to view answers to each problem quickly.  

<hr>

Each challenge uses one file, and challenges are grouped into their years.  
Any year that has challenges I've solved are navigable below.  


Years:
- [2015](./src/advent/2015/)
- 2016
- 2017
- 2018
- 2019
